<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Here you’ll see several questions we get asked quite a bit. Hopefully these will help resolve any possible confusion you may have!</p>

<h3 id="q-whats-its-purpose">Q. What’s it’s purpose?</h3>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Latin can sometimes come across as a difficult language and can be discouraging to students when learning it. This is a problem we strive to fix here at Codiscite. That’s why we’ve put together this completely <strong>FREE</strong> open-source project for anyone to enjoy! Spells Of Latin brings the ideas of this ex-universal language by allowing players to contruct Latin spells using Latin roots and using these ‘spells’ to duel in a 3-dimensional virtual desert.</p>

<h3 id="q-how-do-i-set-it-up">Q. How do I set it up?</h3>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Just download the zip file by selecting “Clone or download” and extract it and the build name inside! From there, you can double click to run the HTML file and you should be all set!</p>

<h3 id="q-how-do-i-use-it">Q. How do I use it?</h3>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Try it out by constructing a spell that has been added by selecting the ‘Spell Workshop’. From here you can put together different roots to craft your own spell from root to acorn! Next at the main menu, click “Play” and then “Training” so that you can try out your spell! Repeat this process and explore the game to find where it will take you! :smiley:</p>
